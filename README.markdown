CCP - Resize Expandable Image
=============================

This is a Photoshop script that will create the appropriate image sizes for our
Expandable Ad units.

Installation
------------
Download `CCP - Resize Expandable Image.jsx` and place it in your Photoshop
scripts folder:

- OS X: `/Applications/Adobe Photoshop <version>/Presets/Scripts/`
- Windows: `C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop <version>\Presets\Scripts\`

Usage
-----

Open the image you want to generate new sizes for and choose *File > Scripts >
CCP - Resize Expandable Image*. The script will determine if it needs to create the sizes
for the upper or lower portion of the ad based on the source image size. New images will be saved in the same directory as the source image and named appropriately.
